# Project-2

Proposal:

We have decided to look at data regarding the air quality of Indian cities using two datasets: one regarding the statistics of the air quality itself and the other providing more information about the cities, such as population, etc.  

The main field of interest is the environment, but could also extend to population data, and data regarding the geography of India is also being utilised.  

The aim is to answer questions such as whether the air quality is related to the population and if it is, what the contrast is between the most and least populated cities.  

We've already obtained the two datasets we want to work with from Kaggle and will be looking for more information we can glean from the results of the datasets.
